        "% FIR filter design with Julia\n% Matti Pastell\n% 21th April 2016\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis an example of a julia script that can be published using\n[Weave](http://mpastell.github.io/Weave.jl/latest/usage/).\nThe script can be executed normally using Julia\nor published to HTML or pdf with Weave.\nText is written in markdown in lines starting with \"`#'` \" and code\nis executed and results are included in the published document.\n\nNotice that you don't need to define chunk options, but you can using\n`#+`. just before code e.g. `#+ term=True, caption='Fancy plots.'`.\nIf you're viewing the published version have a look at the\n[source](FIR_design_plots.jl) to see the markup.\n\n\n# FIR Filter Design\n\nWe'll implement lowpass, highpass and ' bandpass FIR filters. If\nyou want to read more about DSP I highly recommend [The Scientist\nand Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal\nProcessing](http://www.dspguide.com/) which is freely available\nonline.\n\n## Calculating frequency response\n\nDSP.jl package doesn't (yet) have a method to calculate the\nthe frequency response of a FIR filter so we define it:"

        "## Design Lowpass FIR filter\n\nDesigning a lowpass FIR filter is very simple to do with DSP.jl, all you\nneed to do is to define the window length, cut off frequency and the\nwindow. We will define a lowpass filter with cut off frequency at 5Hz for a signal\nsampled at 20 Hz.\nWe will use the Hamming window, which is defined as:\n$w(n) = \\alpha - \\beta\\cos\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}$, where $\\alpha=0.54$ and $\\beta=0.46$"
